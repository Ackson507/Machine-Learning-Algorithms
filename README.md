# Introduction
Let me introduce the basics of building a machine learning model using Python. Python is widely used in the machine learning community due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and ease of use.
- Firstly, we select an IDE which typically includes a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger, all integrated into a single user interface used for writing code. In these projects will either use Pycharm or Jupiter Notebooks;
- Before getting started, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries that will be using in our projects such as;
- Pandas: pandas DataFrame and performing any necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical features
- Numpy: NumPy is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Provides a wide variety of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.
- Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining, data analysis and includes various machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.

# Logistic Regression
### Objective of the model
The objective of this model is to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company in order to identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies. 
### Data Collection and Preparation
Data was collected from the company's CRM system and included customer demographics, service usage, and billing information.
### Feature engineering and processing
Preprocessing steps involved removing duplicates, imputing missing values, and one-hot encoding categorical features. Features such as total usage duration, average monthly spend, and tenure were engineered to provide additional predictive power based on domain expertise and exploratory data analysis.
### Model Building
Several classification algorithms were evaluated, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. 
### Selection of algorithm
The final model, a gradient boosting classifier, was selected based on its superior performance in terms of accuracy and interpretability. 
### Evaluation
- Model performance
The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set, outperforming baseline models. However, further investigation is needed to address class imbalance and explore additional features that may enhance predictive performance.
